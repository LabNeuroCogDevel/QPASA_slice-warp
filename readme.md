# strip and warp
little python GUI to guide through brain extraction (skull stripping) and linear warping an atlas to native space.
 * `warps.bash` and the incluced nifti images (`*.nii*`) follow the FSL pipeline to accomplish this.
 * `strip_and_warp.py` is a guided GUI to select a dicom folder, bet, and warp.
